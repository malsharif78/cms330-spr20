## Catalog description:
Short history of programming languages and their construction. Techniques of language translation including lexical analysis, grammars, and parsers. Analysis of the structure and functionality of modern operating system software, with emphasis on concurrent processes. Topics include: process scheduling, communication, and synchronization; API services; and, design and development of concurrent program using OS features. Prerequisite: CMS 230.

## A better description:
You've now had courses where you built applications (CMS 167, 170, 270) and a course where you learned about the hardware (CMS 230).  But how do lots of applications use one set of hardware?  That's where the operating system comes in.  In this course, we'll concentrate on that middle layer between the hardware and the applications.  

## Goals and Objectives:
1. To understand the abstract concept of virtualization and how it is applied to different parts of hardware including the CPU and memory.
2. To understand the services provided by and the design of an operating system.
3. To understand what a process is and how processes are synchronized and scheduled.
4. Identify and understand common synchronozation errors and bugs.
5. To use system calls for managing processes, memory and the file system.
6. To understand the file system and storage of persistent information.

## Scrummage and Grades:
We will be using a new class management technique called [Scrumage](./scrumage.md) in our course. This takes the
"agile" principles of Scrum used in software companies and applies it to the class environment. You
will be choosing how you want to learn, learning collaboratively, reflecting on the process, and
constantly re-evaluating your choices to make the class an ever-evolving, ever-improving learning
experience.

As such, the course content will be broken into 6-7 sprints. Each sprint
is one (approximately) two-week unit of material, with a problem set or project, quiz, and Scrumage grade. The Scrumage
grade reflects your participation in meetings, use of the Scrum board, completing retrospectives, and
being a valuable team member.

Your grade will be determined by:
* Sprint deliverables: 35%
* Individual quizzes: 35%
* Scrumage grades: 15% 
* Final Exam: 15%

Letter grades: 
* [93-100): A
* [90-93): A-
* [87-90): B+
* [83-87): B
* [80-83): B-
* [77-80): C+
* [73-77): C
* [70-73): C-
* [67-70): D+
* [63-67): D
* [60-63): D-
* [0-60): F

If you or your team disagree with a grade you've received on an assignment, you must let me know within one week of the assignment being returned.  

## Final Exam
This course **will** have a final exam on **Thursday April 30, 11am-1pm.**  This time and date is set by the College and is not changeable. Do not make plans to leave campus before the final exam.  Should you miss the exam, you will be required to submit documentation about the emergency circumstances which required you to miss the exam. 

## Sprints (tentative and subject to change):
* Sprint 0: Basic C programming (review), Github management (review), course overview
* Sprint 1: Virtualization I - Processor
* Sprint 2: Scheduling
* Sprint 3: Virtualization II - Memory
* Sprint 4: Paging and Swapping
* Sprint 5: Concurrency and Synchronization
* Sprint 6: Persistence and File Systems

## What I Expect of You:
* Devote a minimum of 8 hours a week outside of class time
* Tell me when you're struggling and give me the chance to help you.
* Make an effort to work productively in your Scrum teams and follow the Scrum values.  ![Scrum Values image](https://github.com/vsummet/mat310_scrummage_master/blob/master/ScrumValues.png)
* Be patient and respectful with me, your teammates, and yourself
* Notify me in advance when you need to miss a quiz or other in-class activity
* Stay abreast of class information.  Regularly check the class calendar, Canvas notifications, and your email

## Resources:
### If you feel behind your teammates and need individual help:
* Me! - My office hours are listed above.  If they don't work for you, just email me and we'll work out a time to meet.
* Your teammates - This class is deliberately structured to reward your team for working well together and helping each other out.
* The Tutoring Center (we have several CMS330 tutors who are excellent!)
### Your team is struggling to work together and be efficient:
* Me! - My office hours are listed above.  If they don't work for your team, just email me and we'll work out a time to meet.
* Technology - Remember that being a successful team **does not** mean you have to meet in-person or synchronously.  Consider technology tools like [WebEx](https://rollins.teamdynamix.com/TDClient/KB/?CategoryID=11418) or Skype for videoconferencing, Slack (which has a Trello plugin) or GroupMe for team communication, and GoogleDocs as a flexible team workspace for intermediate ideas and documents.
* Shake things up.  Remember that a fundamental tenet of Scrum is that it is **agile.**  Be honest with your team about what is not working, brainstorm during your sprint retrospectives, and try something different the next sprint.

## Accessibility Services
Rollins College is committed to equal access and inclusion for all students, faculty and staff.  The Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 create a foundation of legal obligations to provide an accessible educational environment that does not discriminate against persons with disabilities. It is the spirit of these laws that guides the college toward expanding access in all courses and programs, utilizing innovative instructional design, and identifying and removing barriers whenever possible. 
 
If you are a person with a disability and anticipate needing any type of academic accommodations in order to fully participate in your classes, please contact the Office of Accessibility Services, located on the first floor of the Olin Library, as soon as possible. You are encouraged to schedule a Welcome Meeting by filling out the "First Time Users" form on the website: https://www.rollins.edu/accessibility-services and/or reach out by phone or email: 407-975-6463 or Access@Rollins.edu.

All test-taking accommodations requested for this course must first be approved through the Office of Accessibility Services (OAS) and scheduled online through Accommodate at least 72 hours before the exam. Official accommodation letters must be received by and discussed with the faculty in advance.  There will be no exceptions given unless previously approved by the OAS with documentation of the emergency situation. We highly recommend making all testing accommodations at the beginning of the semester. OAS staff are available to assist with this process.


## Academic Honor Code Reaffirmation
http://www.rollins.edu/honor-code/documents/academic-honor-code-rollins-college.pdf

Membership in the student body of Rollins College carries with it an obligation, and requires a commitment, to act with honor in all things. The student commitment to uphold the values of honor - honesty, trust, respect, fairness, and responsibility - particularly manifests itself in two public aspects of student life. First, as part of the admission process to the College, students agree to commit themselves to the Honor Code. Then, as part of the matriculation process during Orientation, students sign a more detailed pledge to uphold the Honor Code and to conduct themselves honorably in all their activities, both academic and social, as a Rollins student. A student signature on the following pledge is a binding commitment by the student that lasts for his or her entire tenure at Rollins College.

The development of the virtues of Honor and Integrity are integral to a Rollins College education and to membership in the Rollins College community. Therefore, I, a student of Rollins College, pledge to show my commitment to these virtues by abstaining from any lying, cheating, or plagiarism in my academic endeavors and by behaving responsibly, respectfully and honorably in my social life and in my relationships with others. This pledge is reinforced every time a student submits work for academic credit as his/her own. Students shall add to the paper, quiz, test, lab report, etc., the handwritten signed statement:

"On my honor, I have not given, nor received, nor witnessed any unauthorized assistance on this work."

Material submitted electronically should contain the pledge; submission implies signing the pledge.

## Honor Code as applied to CMS330
This class will contain significant teammwork aspects.  For team deliverables, your team is expected to turn in one artifact arrived at collaboratively.  In this case, "appropriate collaboration" (as stated in the Honor Code) is an open exchange of ideas, information, and answers amongst all the members of your team and your team only.  Individual assignments are to be done individually.  You can discuss ideas, concepts, problems etc, but your work must be your own.  A good metric is to discuss something without a pencil in your hand.  Once you are done discussing, pick up your pencil and proceed.  **Never** give/share your work with anyone (or any other team).

*Electronic resources:* You can use electronic resources in this course.  However, you must document outside resources (a resource which is not listed in the Resources section for a sprint).  You can do this by keeping an electronic document (eg. Google doc, etc) and copying and pasting any URLs into it.  Then print and submit this document with your artifact.  This is true for both team and individual deliverables.


# Absences – religious holidays and/or campus business
The professor will accommodate a reasonable number of excused absences for religious holidays and official off-campus college business such as academic conference presentations and athletic competitions. However, per the College’s policy on excused absences (https://catalog.rollins.edu/), students must discuss with the professor the dates of the anticipated absences no later than the last day of the drop period. Students must present to their professor written evidence of the anticipated absences and discuss with him/her how and when make-up work should be completed prior to missing the class. Students should not expect to receive allowance for excused absences if they do not meet with the professor beforehand and clarify the dates as necessary. Absences will be addressed by the faculty member in accordance with his/her attendance policy. The professor retains the right to determine what would be considered to be a reasonable number of absences (excused or otherwise) for the course. A student will not fail a course because the number of religious observances and/or college business absences exceed the number of absences allowed, except if excessive absences make it impossible to fulfill the expectations of the course. The student’s class participation grade in the course, though, may still be affected.


# Credit Hour Statement for Rollins Courses
This course is a four-credit-hour course that meets three hours per week. The value of four credit hours results, in part, from work expected of enrolled students both inside and outside the classroom.  Rollins faculty require that students average at least 2 ½ hours of outside work for every hour of scheduled class time.  In this course, the additional outside-of-class expectations are significant time spent meeting with teams.
 
# Recording Device Use
In order to protect the integrity of the classroom experience, the use of recording devices is limited to either the expressed permission of the faculty member or with proper documentation from the Office of Accessibility Services.  Information about accommodations through Accessibility Services can be found at http://www.rollins.edu/accessibility-services/. Recording without the proper authorization is considered a violation of the Rollins Code of Community Standards.

# Title IX Statement
Rollins College is committed to making its campus a safe place for students. If you tell any of your faculty about sexual misconduct involving members of the campus community, your professors are required to report this information to the Title IX Coordinator. Your faculty member can help connect you with the Title IX Coordinator, (TitleIX@rollins.edu or 407.691.1773). You will be provided with information, resources and support. If you would prefer to speak to someone on campus confidentially, please call the Wellness Center at 407.628.6340. They are not required to report any information you share with the Title IX Coordinator. 

Misconduct under Title IX includes gender-based discrimination and harassment, sexual harassment, sexual violence including fondling and assault, sexual coercion/force, sexual-based communication, sexual exploitation, interpersonal violence including dating and domestic violence, stalking, complicity and retaliation. Everyone is protected under the following protected statuses: sex (including pregnancy), gender, gender identity (including transgender status), gender expression, and sexual orientation.
