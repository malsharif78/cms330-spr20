# Sprint 2: Virtual Memory (Part 1)

# Roadmap:
* Teams
* Sprint Duration: Feb. 6 - 20
* Quiz date/time: Th. Feb. 20 at the start of class
* Requirements due: Tu. Feb. 18th at the end of class

# Rationale: 
Sprint 2 introduces us to virtual memory.  Just like we saw in Sprint 1 with the processor, memory is a finite resource that must be shared among many processes.  So how do we make each process think that it has total freedom in its use of memory?  Virtualization!  

# Responsibilities (What you need to know):
1. Virtual address space (review)
   * Code
   * Heap
   * Stack
   * How virtual addresses and physical addresses are related to each other conceptually
 2. Virtual address translation
    A. Policies
    B. Mechanisms:
       * Base and bounds (a.k.a dynamic relocation)
       * Segmentation (generalized base and bounds)

   * OSTEP: Ch 12 (quick read to orient yourself)
   * OSTEP: Ch 13 (mostly conceptual with big goals of memory virtualization)
   * OSTEP: Ch 15 (base and bounds, skim 15.4 and 15.5)
   * OSTEP: Ch 16 (segmentation -- skim 16.4 and 16.6, omit 16.5)
   * OSTEP: Ch 17 (
# Reality Check:
  * On Tuesday, do basic team setup and introductions.  Do sprint planning meeting.  Work on syllabus worksheet.
  * TODO by next class:  Get Trello accounts and do Scrum reading. Skim worksheet and problem set, noting problems you have no idea where to start or are confused by.
  * Thursday class: Make sure everyone's on Trello.  Discuss the definitions of Scrum if there are any questions. Enter deliverables on Trello, categorize them into In-Progress and Backlog, and assign topics based on topics you had issues with.
  * TODO by next class: Read and work through textbook readings.  Do worksheet(s), focusing on areas you're having trouble with.  Complete the syllabus quiz.
  * Tuesday: Check worksheet and syllabus quiz & make sure everyone understands. Start problem sets together. Check/Ask professor for help if you're stuck.  Play game together.
  * TODO by Thursday: Have "almost final" answers for all problems in problem set.  Some may still need group discussion or further clarification.
  * Thursday: Do final check of problem set.  Make sure problem set is neat, tidy, and meets guidelines.  Turn in your problem set at the end of class.
  * TODO before next class: Play review game if you haven't alreay. Take the practice quiz and check your answers.  Study as a group.  
  * Next Tuesday: Quiz (30 minutes), Sprint XXX retrospective, and Sprint XXX planning.

# Retrospective:
  * Complete this [sprint retrospective survey](https://rollins.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_3rAIzhpHFYbIixf?course=330s20&sprint=2).  Each team member should complete a survey.
