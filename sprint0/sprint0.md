# Sprint 0: Getting Started

# Roadmap:
* Teams
* Sprint Duration: Tuesday 1/14 - Tuesday 1/21
* Quiz time: normally there would be a quiz at the end of the sprint.  No quiz for this sprint.
* Requirements: 
   * Syllabus quiz and problem set due Tuesday, 1/21 at end of class (12:15pm)
   * `project0` code pushed to github by 11:59pm on Tuesday, 1/21

# Rationale: 
Sprint 0 will get you acclimated to the unique way the class will be run.  The first part is ironing out the Scrum process with you.  During this sprint, we will do some background work learning about Scrum (and the online tool Trello) as well as review some basics of working with Mimir and Github.  You will do a very simple problem set, syllabus quiz, and project to make sure we're all on the same page.  All of these requirements are trying to pave the way for the rest of the course: giving us shared tools, shared knowledge base, and shared vocabulary.

I am having you read from a non-technical book about the value of Scrum, the methodology we will be using in this course.  It is from Scrum: The Art of Doing Twice the Work in Half the Time, written by one of the founders of Scrum. It is about why Scrum works, and it contains some crucial motivations for attempting to use a new style of classroom/project management. I find this reading inspirational, and I'm hoping you will too. 

You will also read the first two "chapters" of the textbook.  These provide an overview and a lot of the technical vocabular we'll be using this semster.  Hopefully, these chapters will help you understand and situate future sprints within the overall course.  Project 0 is closely linked to chapter 2 in the textbook and allows you to see some interesting concepts that we'll be exploring further later on.

# Responsibilities (What you need to know):
1. Scrum Processes
   * Define "Backlog", "Burndown charts", "Planning Poker", "Retrospective"
   * Why do we use Scrum?  How is it related to Agile?  What are the core values of each?
   * Be able to use the Trello software.  
2. Review Github interaction basics
   * cloning a repo, committing and pushing to it
   * good code management practices
3. Understand introductory operating system concepts
   * virtualization
   * address space
   * threads
   * persistence
   * file system
4. Review basic C programming
   * command line arguments
   * modify, compile, and run a program
  
# Requirements (What you need to do):
The "Requirements" grade is the problem set and `project0` submission.  The scrum artifacts will be graded in a "Scrumage" grade.

## Individual Requirements:
   * Understand the concepts on the Responsibilities list.
   * Read about Scrum.  Link to pdf is on Canvas.
   * Get an account on Trello.com.  Google "Scrum for Trello" and "Burndown for Trello" and install both these extensions.
   * Complete the [syllabus quiz](./syllabus_quiz.md).  You can work on this as a team, but each member must turn in a signed, individual copy.
   * Complete [project 0](./project0.md) on Mimir using git/Github.

## Team Requirements:
   * Set up a shared board on Trello with your tasks for Sprint 1.  Add me to your board, too (user id: `valeriesummet`)
   * Complete this [problem set](./sprint0_prob_set.pdf).  You may handwrite or type your answers.  But you must turn in a single hardcopy of your final answers.

# Resources:  
I may add to these as we go through the sprint.  Use the [Expert Request](https://rollins.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_0jNfbBpN1clDJfn?course=cms33020&sprint=0) for more resources. 
1. OSTEP Ch. 1 and 2
2. Scrum reading is posted on Canvas
3. Scrum videos - lots are available on YouTube and there is one linked from the scrumage page via the syllabus
4. [git cheat sheet](https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf) (pdf)
5. [CMS 230 C programming materials](https://github.com/vsummet/cms230notes/blob/master/toc-credits.md) (scroll down past the Assembly part)

# Reality Check:
  * On Tuesday, form teams, do basic introductions.  Work on syllabus quiz.
  * TODO by next class:  Get Trello accounts and do Scrum reading. Verify you can log into Github account (or sign up for one if you don't have one for some reason.)  Accept the `project0` link from Github classroom on Canvas. Skim the problem set.  Read OSTEP Ch. 1 and 2 and make notes about anything you found confusing or didn't understand.
  * Thursday class: Make sure everyone's on Trello.  Discuss the definitions of Scrum if there are any questions. Enter deliverables on Trello, categorize them into In-Progress and Backlog, and assign topics based on reading topics you had issues with.  Discuss problem set and begin to write rough draft answers for each question.
  * TODO by next class: Complete the syllabus quiz. Clone repo to Mimir and begin working on project 0.  Refine problem set answers and come prepared with last-minute questions or confusion for your teammates.
  * Tuesday: Check syllabus quiz & make sure everyone understands. Cleanup and finalize answers for problem set.  Turn in syllabus quiz and problem set at the end of class.  Cleanup `project0` code, comment, and push to github for your final submission before 11:59pm.  Complete the sprint retrospective survey (below).

# Retrospective:
  * Complete this [sprint retrospective survey](https://rollins.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_3rAIzhpHFYbIixf?course=cms33020&sprint=0).  Each team member should complete a survey.
