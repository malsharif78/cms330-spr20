# Sprint 4: Concurrency

# Roadmap:
* Teams
* Sprint Duration: Mar. 5 - Mar. 22 (3 week sprint!)
* Quiz date/time: Mar. 22 at the start of class
* Requirements due: 

# Rationale: 
Sprint 4 will introduce to another fundamental concept in modern operating systems: concurrency.  Concurrency means a program with multiple threads. Think of this like having minions: you can direct many small minions to run around and do your bidding.  In this sprint, you'll work with a new programming concept (threads) and hopefully get them to do your bidding by the end of the sprint.  You'll have to learn how to protect and synchronize access to resources that threads need to share. We'll also see classic concurrency and synchronization problems like deadlock and race conditions.

I may add to these as we go through the sprint.  Use the [Expert Request](https://rollins.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_0jNfbBpN1clDJfn?course=cms330s20&sprint=4) for more resources. 
   * OSTEP 26, 28, (these contain the theoretical background of threads)  Chapter 27 is a code chapter particularly relevant to the project.
   * A 30-40 minute [hands-on lab activity](./lab-concurrency.md) which introduces the basics of how to create and manipulate threads.
   
# Reality Check:
  * On Thursday, do basic team setup and introductions.  Do sprint planning meeting and setup Trello board.
  * TODO by next class:  Skim chapter 27.  Do hands-on lab activity.  Setup project code.  
  * Thursday class: 
  * TODO by next class: enjoy Spring Break!
  * Tuesday:

  * Next Tuesday: Quiz (30 minutes), Sprint 4 retrospective, and Sprint 5 planning.
  

# Retrospective:
  * Complete this [sprint retrospective survey](https://rollins.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_3rAIzhpHFYbIixf?course=330s20&sprint=4).  Each team member should complete a survey.
