  * TODO by next class: Read and work through textbook readings.  Do worksheet(s), focusing on areas you're having trouble with.  Complete the syllabus quiz.
  * Tuesday: Check worksheet and syllabus quiz & make sure everyone understands. Start problem sets together. Check/Ask professor for help if you're stuck.  Play game together.
  * TODO by Thursday: Have "almost final" answers for all problems in problem set.  Some may still need group discussion or further clarification.
  * Thursday: Do final check of problem set.  Make sure problem set is neat, tidy, and meets guidelines.  Turn in your problem set at the end of class.
  * TODO before next class: Play review game if you haven't alreay. Take the practice quiz and check your answers.  Study as a group.
